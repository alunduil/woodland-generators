/**
 * Core generator utilities
 *
 * This module provides a comprehensive set of reusable functions for:
 * - Choice validation and generation with built-in user input validation
 * - Random generation patterns used across all character generators
 *
 * All functions follow consistent patterns with proper error handling,
 * logging, and type safety. User selection validation is integrated
 * directly into generation functions for a simplified, robust API.
