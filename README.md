A CLI tool for generating resources for Root: The Tabletop RPG.

**By [Alex Brandt](https://github.com/alunduil)**

## What this tool does

Woodland Generators helps your Root RPG games by giving you:

- **Character Generator**: Make random animal characters with traits and
  backgrounds that fit their group
- **NPC Generator**: Create non-player characters for your woodland games
- **Clearing Generator**: Build unique clearings with different features,
  people, power struggles, and conflicts
- **Export Options**: Save to PDF for printing, JSON for data sharing, Markdown
  for editing, or HTML for web viewing

Great for GMs who want to fill their woodland with fun characters and places.
Also good for players who need ideas for making characters. Works with any
online tool or tabletop game.
